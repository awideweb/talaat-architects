## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
1. Tailwind configuration must be updated before component styling
2. Image optimization must be complete before lazy loading implementation
3. Header component must be finalized before page-specific integrations
4. Basic accessibility fixes must precede advanced accessibility features

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Image optimization can be worked on alongside Tailwind configuration
- Footer component development can happen parallel to Header work
- Contact page redesign can be developed alongside homepage optimizations
- Testing can begin as soon as each component is completed

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- Next.js 15 development environment
- Mobile device simulators (iOS/Android)
- Accessibility testing tools (screen readers, WAVE, axe)
- Performance testing tools (Lighthouse, WebPageTest)
- Image optimization tools (Sharp, Squoosh)

### Testing Devices
- iPhone (various models and iOS versions)
